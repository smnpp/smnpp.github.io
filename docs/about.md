I am a **Machine Learning Student** currently pursuing a double degree at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** in Stockholm and **INSA Lyon** in France. My academic journey is driven by a deep fascination with how AI can solve complex problems, particularly at the intersection of **Financial Mathematics** and **Deep Learning**.

I enjoy bridging the gap between research and production. During my recent internship as a **Data Engineer at LCL (Crédit Lyonnais)**, I led the design and deployment of a RAG-based AI chatbot, honing my skills in building scalable Python pipelines and working with LLMs. I also developed a strong foundation in **C++** and **statistical modeling**, which I use to tackle performance-critical challenges.

I am actively seeking a **6-month Master Thesis (End-of-Studies Internship)** starting in **early summer 2026**. I am eager to apply advanced Machine Learning techniques to real-world challenges—specifically within quantitative finance, NLP, or predictive modeling.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss!
